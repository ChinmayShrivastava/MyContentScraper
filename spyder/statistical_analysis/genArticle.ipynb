       "\"Introduction\\n\\nEver heard the joke about the security engineer who reassured his client that his new secure drive was impervious to all current hacking tactics, only to have the client lose key data when his nine-year-old discovered the drive and used it as a coaster? This humorous anecdote might elicit a chuckle or two, but it underscores a serious vulnerability in data security, a field that has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years due to a sharp increase in cybercrime. Cybercrimes have accelerated by 10% over the past year, triggering an average hit of $9.44 million per data breach in the United States alone, based on data for 2022. The frequency of cyberattacks is astounding, with approximately 2,200 occurring daily, translating to a cyberattack every 39 seconds. In 2022, 1,506 data breaches occurred owing to data phishing attacks, exposing an estimated 164.68 million records.\\n\\nMoving beyond these alarming statistics, let's delve into the heart of the matter â€“ sensitive data. Sensitive data is any kind of information that is protected against unwarranted disclosure. To comprehend the gravity of data breaches, it's important to understand what sensitive data is and why it's crucial to protect it. Access to this data can be devastating; this is borne out by the egregious data breaches of 2022 where a hacker posted personal information of 487 million WhatsApp users, while the Australian healthcare and insurance provider Medibank suffered a data leak that resulted in the theft of 97 million people's information. Unfortunately, according to recent findings, 53% of organizations leave 1,000 or more files with sensitive data open to all employees, and the average company has 534,465 files containing data that would be classified as sensitive. Hence, it is easy to understand why sensitive data protection is a critical concern requiring immediate and effective regulations.\""
